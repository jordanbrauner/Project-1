# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Good job documenting your user stories, approach and backlog in your readme. Encourage you to think of what else you could add (e.g., installation instructions) that would make it easier for somebody looking at your code for the first time to get your app up-and-running quickly.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Very impressed with all the features you added to your game. Small things like showing which colors have been successfully matched are evidence that you put a lot of time and effort into this. Next step would be to hammer out tile randomization.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Your code was very easy to read and made good use of comments. There are opportunities to make your code more DRY (e.g., encapsulate repeated code into functions). Also suggest removing commented-out code from your master branch before submitting projects. More on that in my inline code comments, which are linked to below.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Again, great job! You should be seriously proud of what you've accomplished here. And your design skills are top-notch. Excited to see what other games you come up with for future projects. Strongly encourage you to tackle deck shuffling.
