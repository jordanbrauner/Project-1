User Story #1: As a user I should be able to reset the game if I'm having a bad run so I can save time.

User Story #2: As a user I should be able to see how many chances I have before the game ends so I can play effectively.

User Story #3: As a user I should be able to adust the game's difficulty to accommodate my skill level.

User Story #4: The user should be rewarded for their performance by way of an achievement system to encourage them to keep playing.

User Story #5: As a user I should have a score chart to show my score history.
